    "The <b>Biot-Savart Law</b> describes how currents produce magnetic fields: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "       \\mathbf{B}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi}\\int\\frac{I\\,d\\vec{\\ell}\\times ({\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}^{\\prime})}}{|r-r^\\prime|^3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In this expression, $\\vec{r}$ is a field point (we use a grid to sample field points), and the integral runs over all the currents, whose positions are labeled by the vector $\\vec{r}^\\prime$. The field point $\\vec{r}$ is fixed for a particular integration. In general, this integral is difficult to evaluate analytically. This is why most introductory courses on E&M typically restrict their attention to examples like infinite straight wires, or the axis of symmetry of a loop. Fortunately, computers have no such limitations, and neither do we.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Biot-Savart Law bears a strong mathematical resemblance to Coulomb's Law. Consequently, our numerical approach to integrating it is also similar. You may want to review [Computer Homework #2](https://github.com/Phys260WI2020/HW2/blob/master/HW_02_solutions.ipynb) to refresh your memory about electric field calculations. \n",

    "    - Extend the loop example to two loops\n",
    "    - Solve for Helmholz coils both analytically and numerically\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will exploit the fact that these cases have common code to avoid re-writing code.  This includes the code to calculate the magnetic field at a point due to any number of current elements, $Id\\vec{l}$. \n",

    "### Two new computational concepts:\n",

You will still want only *one* array for the `self.dl`, `self.xwire`, `self.ywire`, and `self.zwire` in your Wire objects, even if you have distinct wires. This is possible because, for simplicity, the current in all of the configurations below is still $I=1$Amp.  Test out concatentating two 2x3 arrays below.  Note that you can change the axis of concatenation.  I have put in some starter things to test,but you should examine the effects of `np.concatenate` on your own.  The alternative way to do the assignment is to compute the individual contributions to the magnetic field, then add later."
